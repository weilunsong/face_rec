1. implement facenet and tensorflow-GPU
2. Download CASIA-WebFace and LFW
	CASIA link is broken after I download it
	LWF: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz
3. Code is from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet
4. Alignment image to 160*160 using align_dataset_mtcnn.py file
5. Compare image distance use compare.py file
6. Train model use train_tripletloss.py file, this file contains a validation part, which can validate dataset after training automaticely.
7. Validate_on_LFW.py can select any model to do the validation on test data.
